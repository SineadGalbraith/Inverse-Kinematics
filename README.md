# Inverse Kinematics

The objective of this assignment was to learn how Inverse Kinematics works in practice by creating an arm and torso structure that works out appropriate orientations for the lower and upper arm given the desired position of the end effector (hand).

This assignment contains code for both an Analytical Solution and a Cyclic-Coordinate Descent (CCD) Solution to Inverse Kinematics.

C/C++ and OpenGL have been used for this assignment.
